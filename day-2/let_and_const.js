// // The let keyword allows you to declare variables that can be updated or reassigned later. You can think of let as a flexible container – once you've stored a value in it, you can change that value as needed throughout your program.

// // Here's an example of declaring and assigning a variable with let:

// // let score = 10;
// // // In this case, the variable score is declared and assigned the value 10. If you want to update the value later, you can easily do that:

// // let score = 10;
// // console.log(score); // 10
// // score = 20;
// // console.log(score); // 20
// // // Now, score holds the value 20. This makes let particularly useful when you know the value of a variable will change as your program runs.

// // On the other hand, const is used to declare variables that are constant. Once you assign a value to a variable declared with const, you cannot reassign it.

// // This makes const ideal for values that you don't want to change accidentally during the execution of your program.

// // Here's an example of declaring and assigning a variable with const:

// // const maxScore = 100;
// // console.log(maxScore); // 100
// // Once maxScore is assigned the value 100, it cannot be changed:

// // maxScore = 200; // This will result in an error
// // Trying to reassign a value to a const variable will throw an error in your JavaScript console, as const variables are immutable once they are assigned.


// // -------------------x-----------------------------x--------------------------x-------------------x----------------

// You can declare a let variable without immediately assigning it a value, and you can assign it a value later:

// let age;
// console.log(age); // undefined
// age = 25;
// console.log(age); // 25
// Variables declared with const must be assigned a value at the time of declaration. If you try to declare a const variable without assigning it a value, you will get an error:

// const age; // Error: Missing initializer in const declaration
// You should use let when you need to declare variables that will be reassigned later. For example, tracking a changing score or updating a value over time in your program.

// Use const when you want to declare variables that should remain constant, like configuration values or settings that shouldn't be changed accidentally.

// You can also use the var keyword, but it's not as recommended anymore. The var is kind of like let, except it has a wider scope, which is more likely to cause problems in your program.

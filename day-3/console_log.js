//What Is console.log Used For, and How Does It Work?
//To use console.log(), you call the method with the value or message you want to output inside the parentheses. Here are some examples:

// console.log("Hello, world!");

// let num = 5;
// console.log(num); // 5
// The first example prints Hello, world! in the browser's console, while the second example prints the value 5.


// Here is another example of working with console.log():

// let name = "Alice";
// console.log("Hello, " + name + "!"); // Hello, Alice!
// You can also pass in multiple values to console.log() separated by commas. For example:

// let name = "Alice";
// let age = 25;
// console.log("Name:", name, "Age:", age); // Name: Alice Age: 25
// This is helpful for logging multiple pieces of information at once.






// In JavaScript, a semicolon (;) is used to indicate the end of a statement.

// Just as a period (.) marks the end of a sentence in English, a semicolon signifies the end of an executable line of code. This allows the JavaScript engine to distinguish between separate commands.

// For example:

// let variableOne = 5;  // Declare a variable and assign a value
// let variableTwo = 10; // Declare another variable and assign a value
// In this code, the semicolons at the end of each line mark the end of each statement. Without them, the JavaScript engine might have trouble interpreting where one statement ends and another begins.
